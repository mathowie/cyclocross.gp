### Points

The best six out of seven placings in the series will count in the final tally (dropping the one race with the fewest points). Riders must race in at least 5 races for the overall series. Series prizes will be awarded at the series end party. There will be no BAR points for the series, only the individual races.

Points will be rewarded to the top 30 placings according to [this schedule](http://cyclocross.gp/Individualseriesscoring.pdf). Series scoring follows [this criteria](http://cyclocross.gp/SeriesScoring.pdf) and team scoring follows [this criteria](http://cyclocross.gp/Teamscoringforsingleevents.pdf). Reminder: only your top 6 results count and a minimum of 5 race results needed to have a series overall final ranking. Point totals and point standings will be handled by OBRA and we'll link to them each week in the updates.

### PODIUMS/LEADERS JERSEY

A short podium ceremony will follow each finish at the races. A GPCM leaders jersey provided by Castelli will be awarded to the leader of select categories during a short podium ceremony after their race. The points leader of each category is required to wear their leader's jersey while they maintain their lead.

### FIELD LIMITS

To ensure a high level of quality racing, fields will be limited to 75 racers per category

### SERIES STANDINGS

Points for the series will be tracked at OBRA. They will continue to be updated after each race. We are not doing a points percentage transfer when upgraded.

### Membership and licenses

### Prize List
