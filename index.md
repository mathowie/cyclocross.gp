The Grand Prix Candi Murray is a Cyclocross Series composed of seven independently promoted CX races. These great independent races kick off the OBRA Cyclocross season and run from the start of September to the end of October. Riders from any state are welcome to race the GPCM. Series overall awards and prizes will be handed out at the GPCM series end party, in late October. Come experience some amazing cyclocross courses, competitive racing and exciting new race venues.

## Races

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and host it under a custom domain name.
* You want to create a single-page website that's mostly text, like [Know Your Company](https://knowyourcompany.com/).
* You want to share a single markdown file and tried GitHub Gist ([example](https://gist.github.com/dypsilon/5819504)), but would like something nicer-looking.
* You want something like GitHub's [automatic page generator](http://pages.github.com/) for a non-code repository.

This page itself is built with Solo. It's generated from [this markdown file](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/blob/gh-pages/_includes/index.md).

## Usage

First, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). Then download Solo from its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chibicode/solo). Start Jekyll and you should see this page up and running.

**The main file you'll be editing is `index.md`**. This becomes the content for the page.

### Other Files

* Edit `_config.yml` to change the site's title and description.
* Edit `_includes/head.html` to add custom code to `<head>`.
* Edit `_includes/scripts.html` to add custom code before `</body>`.
* Edit `CNAME` to host on a custom domain.
* Edit `README.md` before pushing your code.

### Don't use `<h1>` tags

Wthin `index.md`, do not use `<h1>` tags - `<h1>` is reserved for the site title.

### Supported Tags

Solo supports lists, `<hr>`s, `<table>`s,

> blockquotes, and...

~~~html
<pre>code blocks with syntax highlighting.</pre>
~~~

### Keep Solo up to date

Instead of downloading, you can [fork Solo](https://github.com/chibicode/solo/fork) and use the "upstream" strategy described on [this page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to keep Solo up to date.
