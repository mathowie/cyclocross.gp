			The rains finally appeared for the Ninkrossi race at Washougal MX park in Southern Washington. A deceptively small course featured lots of ups and downs and a fair bit of the slippery stuff as the skies offered up a touch of rain throughout the day. <a href="https://www.athletepath.com/grand-prix-tina-brubaker/2012-10-13">Results are up at Athletepath</a>.

			Another amazing day of racing in the warm sun took place at Heiser Farms, where 365 racers battled the bumps, dust, gravel, mud, and jumps. The pumpkin cannon blasted in the background as racers jostled for positions. <a href="https://www.athletepath.com/grand-prix-tina-brubaker/2012-10-06">Race results are up at Athletepath</a>. Photos from the event are available (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathowie/sets/72157631709318883/">1</a>) as well as <a href="https://vimeo.com/50968216">Kent Johnston's amazing video of the day's racing and fun around the farm</a>.

				Riders wanted a tough race and they certainly got it in Vancouver, WA this past Saturday. It was a sunny mostly warm day coupled with a course that featured drops, climbs, and so much sand that most riders' shoes were filled by the end of the race. <a href="https://www.athletepath.com/grand-prix-tina-brubaker/2012-09-22">Race results are up on Athletepath</a>.
